Hey there, I'm Matei Buzdea (also known as "mtib"), a wannabe security researcher. Currently I'm studying Computer Science at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest and working as a Security Engineer at [Pentest-Tools.com](https://pentest-tools.com). When I get the time, I also play CTFs with my team, [The Few Chosen](https://thefewchosen.com), and brainstorm challenge ideas for various competitions ([TFC CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/2822), Defcamp, etc).

In the past, I've been a member of the ECSC Team Romania and a Physics Olympiad gold medalist.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/MateiBuzdea/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matei-buzdea/) or [X](https://x.com/MateiBuzdea).
